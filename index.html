    <h5>PROFILE</h5>
    <p>“I have just over a year of experience as a junior software engineer with First Technology. In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project for one of the firm's 
        long-time clients.

        “Prior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, where I honed my mobile app
         development skills. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an area
        where I know your firm excels.”</p>
